I am a Software Engineer at [Apple, Inc.](http://www.apple.com/) in the Siri team. I did my undergrad in Computer Science + Mathematics + Economics at the [University of Toronto](http://www.utoronto.ca/)

I like to work on many software things, usually don't matter what, as long as I get to stare at a screen and write code all day. Outside of work, I like to hack mostly light weight applications and text-based hackable games. My current skillsets and interests include: Apache Spark 2.3, Scala 2.x, Java 8, AngularJS/Typescript, Apache hive, Hadoop and its related technologies with a side of obligatory Python 2.7, 3.x.

I also row on my spare time, currently out of [Bair Island Aquatic Center](http://www.gobair.org/), and [Victoria City Rowing Club](https://www.vcrc.bc.ca/). While I try to maintain a low profile of my athletic involvements, some inevitably gets recorded in the annals, to much of my chagrin. You can learn more about my rowing career by stalking World Rowing website, or regattacentral, or both, if you are so inclined.

On my fractional spare time, I can be found volunteering for causes I care: [The Women's March](https://www.womensmarch.com/), [March For Our Lives](https://marchforourlives.com/home/). I tinker with things around me. I can be found fixing cars, making DIY makeup, and playing violin.
